## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 1. Deep Code Review & Bug Detection
* **Automated Debugging:** Identifies logical errors, syntax issues, and edge cases.
* **Severity Levels:** Categorizes issues as *Critical*, *Warning*, or *Suggestion* to help you prioritize fixes.

### ⚡ 2. Intelligent Optimizations
* **Performance Gains:** Suggests more efficient algorithms or data structures.
* **Refactoring Diffs:** Provides "Improved Code" snippets that you can compare directly with your own logic.

### 👶 3. "Explain Like I'm 12" (ELI12) Mode
* **Conceptual Clarity:** Translates complex nested loops and abstract concepts into simple, relatable metaphors. Perfect for mastering difficult topics like recursion or dynamic programming.

### 📈 4. Complexity Analysis
* **Big O Metrics:** Automatically calculates Time and Space complexity ($O(n)$, $O(log n)$, etc.).
* **Reasoning:** Provides a breakdown of *why* your code has its specific complexity profile.

### 🧠 5. Interview Simulation Mode (Recruiter Favorite)
* **Dynamic Questions:** Generates 3-5 technical interview questions based *specifically* on the code you just wrote.
* **Hint System:** Includes progressive hints to help you practice solving problems under pressure.
